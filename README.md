# Chess Game in Python
This is a simple chess game written in Python using the pygame library. It allows two players to play chess on the same computer, or one player to play against a basic AI opponent. The game follows the standard rules of chess, including castling, en passant, and checkmate.

# Requirements
To run this game, you need to have Python 3 and pygame installed on your computer. You can install pygame using pip:

```pip install pygame```

# How to play
To start the game, run the main.py file:

```python main.p```

You will see a chess board with pieces on it. The white pieces belong to player 1, and the black pieces belong to player 2 (or the AI). To move a piece, click on it and then click on the square where you want to move it. If the move is valid, the piece will move. If the move is invalid, you will hear a beep sound and the piece will stay in its original position.

# You can also use the keyboard to control the game:

Press R to restart the game.
Press Q to quit the game.
The game will end when one of the players is checkmated, or when there is a stalemate (no legal moves for either player).
